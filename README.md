Iâ€™m an aspiring ultralearner and an efficiency aficionado. Ultralearning refers to a learning style characterized by an intense and self-directed effort. The vast majority of my programming knowledge comes from my adoption of this learning strategy, allowing me to acquire knowledge at a speed unparalleled by curated curriculums. Efficiency fuels my desire to explore new methods and tools to solve everyday problems. My pursuit for an efficient workflow is marked by a commitment to my decisions, rarely wavering even when faced with struggle or discouragement. My unique learning style combined with my unconventional passion for efficiency establishes an environment which fosters the pursuit of knowledge. I endeavour to utilize the knowledge I gain to better the lives of others and help others discover their own productive workflow that enables them to produce their own work of an unrivaled quality.

## Notable Projects:

[**Tabulo**](https://tabulo.app) (July 2020 - Present): My friends and I are working on an app that seeks to provide a suitable virtual replacement for the classroom whiteboard. I developed most of the frontend using [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev), as well as the backend using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [Redis](https://redis.io), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org). Tabulo is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com), leveraging the use of scripts written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to automate mundane tasks and to enhance developer experience.

[**ChemShooter**](https://chemshooter.herokuapp.com) (June 2020): My friends and I built a game in 36 hours for [Hack the Northeast](https://hackthenortheast.com) and won the Best Gaming Hack Prize with minimal prior game development experience. It was built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io), and you can check it out at [its Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/chemshooter) or at [its GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ChemShooter/ChemShooter).

[**Traduit**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Traduit) (April 2020): I built a Browser Extension to help me save translations from WordReference into my Anki deck as flashcards using [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

[**Fulm**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Fulm) (March 2020): I created a cross-platform timelapse screen recorder built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) as a side-project to learn this cool framework.

[**Various Hackathon Projects**](https://devpost.com/leonzalion) (September 2019 - August 2020): I've also participated in 30 hackathons and used various technologies to build projects in short periods of time. Some of these technologies include [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), and [Electron](https://electronjs.org). I'm currently taking a break from hackathons to focus more on long-term projects.
