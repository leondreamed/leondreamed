Hi! I'm Leon, an aspiring ultralearner!

I love pushing my limits with working on new projects and constantly learning new technologies. Here are some notable projects that I've worked on:

[**Tabulo**](https://tabulo.app) (July 2020 - Present): An app that seeks to provide a suitable replacement for the classroom whiteboard. I developed most of the frontend using [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org), as well as the backend using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [Redis](https://redis.io), and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org).

**Muqo** (June 2020 - July 2020): Wrote an app for a startup from scratch using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), as well as the backend using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org).

[**ChemShooter**](https://chemshooter.herokuapp.com) (June 2020): Built a game in 36 hours for [Hack the Northeast](https://hackthenortheast.com) and won Best Gaming Hack Prize. It was built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io), and you can check it out at [its DevPost page](https://devpost.com/software/chemshooter).

[**Fulm**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Fulm) (March 2020): A cross-platform timelapse screen recorder built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org).

[**Various Hackathon Projects**](https://devpost.com/leonzalion) (September 2019 - Present): Partipated in many hackathons and used various technologies to build projects in short periods of time. Some of these technologies include [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), [Electron](https://electronjs.org), and [PHP](https://php.net).
