Hi, I'm Leon, and I love going above and beyond in everything I do.

It all started with my passion for ultralearning—a learning strategy characterized by intense and self-directed efforts. With the help of ultralearning, I became a self-taught programmer in just 2 weeks by studying a C++ textbook for over 10 hours every day during the winter break.

Fueled by my love for intensity, I went on to attend over 25 hackathons in under an year—an unprecedented pace for a high school student.

While others were looking for internships, I went on to co-found a startup and developed an enterprise-level app—writing over 100,000 lines of code in under a year.

Wishing to give back to the community, I recruited a few friends and together, we organized a first-iteration hackathon, independent of any organization. In under two months, we successfully organized ULHacks, a virtual hackathon which attracted 13 sponsors and reached over 200 participants.

I was never born crazy—in fact, I had been pretty much the opposite of crazy before high school. It was only during those four years where I transformed my mindset and made the decision to reject the status quo and to start doing crazy things.

There's a difference between being crazy and choosing to be crazy—and that choice makes all the difference.

## Notable Projects:

[**Tabulo**](https://tabulo.app) (July 2020 - Present): My friends and I are working on an app that seeks to provide a suitable virtual replacement for the classroom whiteboard. I developed most of the frontend using [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev), as well as the backend using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [Redis](https://redis.io), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org). Tabulo is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com), leveraging the use of scripts written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to automate mundane tasks and to enhance developer experience.

[**ChemShooter**](https://chemshooter.herokuapp.com) (June 2020): My friends and I built a game in 36 hours for [Hack the Northeast](https://hackthenortheast.com) and won the Best Gaming Hack Prize with minimal prior game development experience. It was built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io), and you can check it out at [its Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/chemshooter) or at [its GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ChemShooter/ChemShooter).

[**Traduit**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Traduit) (April 2020): I built a Browser Extension to help me save translations from WordReference into my Anki deck as flashcards using [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

[**Fulm**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Fulm) (March 2020): I created a cross-platform timelapse screen recorder built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) as a side-project to learn this cool framework.

[**Various Hackathon Projects**](https://devpost.com/leonzalion) (September 2019 - August 2020): I've also participated in 30 hackathons and used various technologies to build projects in short periods of time. Some of these technologies include [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), and [Electron](https://electronjs.org). I'm currently taking a break from hackathons to focus more on long-term projects.
