It's not enough to live up to expectations—you'll only end up living the same life as everybody else. Those who have made the biggest impact on the world are those who have defied the world's expectations.

## Notable Projects:

[**DrillDev**](https://github.com/Drill-Dev/drilldev) (August 2021 - Present): After becoming frustrated with the lack of a way to practice and prove our software development skills in a way that's comparable between developers, my friends and I are creating DrillDev, a site that allows you to solve software development problems (e.g. building a website, a backend, a mobile app) that would get automatically graded, similar to many competitive programming sites. The website is still in very early stages of development, and we're looking for people who'd be interested in helping us turn this idea into reality—if you are, feel free to shoot me an email! 

[**Tabulo**](https://tabulo.app) (July 2020 - Present): My friends and I are working on an app that seeks to provide a suitable virtual replacement for the classroom whiteboard. I developed most of the frontend using [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev), as well as the backend using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [Redis](https://redis.io), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org). Tabulo is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com), leveraging the use of scripts written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to automate mundane tasks and to enhance developer experience.

[**ChemShooter**](https://chemshooter.herokuapp.com) (June 2020): My friends and I built a game in 36 hours for [Hack the Northeast](https://hackthenortheast.com) and won the Best Gaming Hack Prize with minimal prior game development experience. It was built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io), and you can check it out at [its Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/chemshooter) or at [its GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ChemShooter/ChemShooter).

[**Traduit**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Traduit) (April 2020): I built a Browser Extension to help me save translations from WordReference into my Anki deck as flashcards using [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

[**Fulm**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Fulm) (March 2020): I created a cross-platform timelapse screen recorder built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) as a side-project to learn this cool framework.

[**Various Hackathon Projects**](https://devpost.com/leonzalion) (September 2019 - August 2020): I've also participated in 30 hackathons and used various technologies to build projects in short periods of time. Some of these technologies include [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), and [Electron](https://electronjs.org). I'm currently taking a break from hackathons to focus more on long-term projects.

## Technologies

**Note:** I believe that it's better to master a small set of programming languages that apply to as many programming fields as possible.

**Universal:**
- JavaScript [(TypeScript)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

**Frontend:**
- HTML [(Pug)](https://pugjs.org)
- CSS [(TailwindCSS)](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)

**Database:**
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)
- [Redis](https://redis.io)

**Testing:**
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- [Cypress](https://cypress.io)

**Devops:**
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

**When performance matters:**
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
