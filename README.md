### Notable Projects:

[**Tabulo**](https://tabulo.app) (July 2020 - Present): My friends and I are working on an app that seeks to provide a suitable virtual replacement for the classroom whiteboard. I developed most of the frontend using [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev), as well as the backend using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [Redis](https://redis.io), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org). I'm also writing unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and end-to-end tests with [Cypress](https://cypress.io). We're also currently experimenting with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

[**ChemShooter**](https://chemshooter.herokuapp.com) (June 2020): My friends and I built a game in 36 hours for [Hack the Northeast](https://hackthenortheast.com) and won the Best Gaming Hack Prize with minimal prior game development experience. It was built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io), and you can check it out at [its Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/chemshooter) or at [its GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ChemShooter/ChemShooter).

[**Traduit**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Traduit) (April 2020): I built a Browser Extension to help me save translations from WordReference into my Anki deck as flashcards using [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

[**Fulm**](https://github.com/leonzalion/Fulm) (March 2020): I created a cross-platform timelapse screen recorder built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) as a side-project to learn this cool framework.

[**Various Hackathon Projects**](https://devpost.com/leonzalion) (September 2019 - August 2020): I've also participated in 29 hackathons and used various technologies to build projects in short periods of time. Some of these technologies include [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), [Electron](https://electronjs.org), and [PHP](https://php.net). I'm currently taking a break to focus more on long-term projects.
